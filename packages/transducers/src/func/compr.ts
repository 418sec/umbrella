/**
 * Reducer composition helper. Takes existing reducer `rfn` (a 3-tuple)
 * and a reducing function `fn`. Returns a new reducer tuple of this
 * form:
 *
 * ```
 * [rfn[0], rfn[1], fn]
 * ```
 *
 * `rfn[2]` reduces values of type `B` into an accumulator of type `A`.
 * `fn` accepts values of type `C` and produces interim results of type
 * `B`, which are then (possibly) passed to the "inner" `rfn[2]`
 * function. Therefore the resulting reducer takes inputs of `C` and an
 * accumulator of type `A`.
 *
 * It is assumed that `fn` internally calls `rfn[2]` to pass its own
 * results for further processing by the nested reducer `rfn`.
 *
 * @param rfn
 * @param fn
