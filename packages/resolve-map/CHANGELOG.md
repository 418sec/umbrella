# [1.0.0](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/compare/@thi.ng/resolve-map@0.2.0...@thi.ng/resolve-map@1.0.0) (2018-04-16)


### Features

* **resolve-map:** support relative parent refs, update tests/readme ([a379d12](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/a379d12))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **resolve-map:** lookup paths passed to the provided `resolve()` fn
inside function values are now relative by default (previously only
absolute paths were allowed)

- remove `resolveArray()` from module exports
(use `resolveMap()` instead)
- add absPath() to compute absolute path
- add support for "../" ancestor access
