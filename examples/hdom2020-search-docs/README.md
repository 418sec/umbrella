# hdom2020-search-docs

[Live demo](http://demo.thi.ng/umbrella/hdom2020-search-docs/)

[@thi.ng/hdom2020](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/hdom2020)
based docstring search example.

## Building

**IMPORTANT: The search index (`search.json`) is not checked into git
(~350KB) and must be downloaded from:**

https://gist.github.com/postspectacular/8370adeaf262299065db4aa5849e40d7

Without it, the example will work. The search index itself was generated
with a yet-to-be-published source file indexing tool (using the Trie
implementation of
[@thi.ng/associative](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/associative)).

Please refer to the [example build instructions](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/wiki/Example-build-instructions) on the wiki.
