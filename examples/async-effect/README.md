# async-effect

[Live demo](http://demo.thi.ng/umbrella/async-effect/)

```
git clone https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella.git
cd umbrella/examples/async-effect
yarn install
yarn build
```

Unlike other examples, this one requires a local webserver to function, for example:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Ps. You can also run the demo without server, but this only good for testing
the error event handling :)
