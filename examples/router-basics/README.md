# router-basics

[Live demo](http://demo.thi.ng/umbrella/router-basics/)

```
git clone https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella.git
cd umbrella/examples/router-basics
yarn install
yarn build
```

Unlike other examples, this one requires a local webserver to function, for example:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

## Notes

It is by design that loading of user #3 ("Emilia Fox") is failing. This
is to demonstrate error handling behavior...
