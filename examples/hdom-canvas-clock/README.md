Note: Currently, some of the packages used by this demo are only
available as pre-releases (e.g. `"@thi.ng/hdom": "^5.0.0-alpha"`).

The example project also assumes that [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) is
installed globally.

git clone -b develop https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella.git
cd umbrella/examples/hdom-canvas-clock
yarn install
yarn start
```
